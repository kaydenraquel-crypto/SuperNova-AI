# Compliance checklist (non-exhaustive)
- Clear **disclosures**: not an RIA, not financial advice; educational only (until licensed).
- **Client profiling**: risk, objectives, time horizon, liquidity needs, constraints.
- **Suitability engine**: map advice to profile; restrict inappropriate instruments for low-risk clients.
- **Recordkeeping**: log inputs, outputs, model versions, datasets, decisions; exportable reports.
- **Conflicts of interest**: none today; log any affiliate links or broker relationships.
- **Data protection**: PII encryption at rest; API keys stored securely; access audit.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: option to require human review for high-impact actions.
Consult legal counsel for your jurisdiction (SEC/FINRA/MiFID II, etc.).
